                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h3><p>This installation profoundly explores the philosophy of transience and eternity in life. In a space
                    created by a black wooden frame and transparent acrylic panels, coloured woolen threads
                    intertwine and weave under the control of stepper motors, figuratively simulating the jumping of
                    a timeline and the cutting of space. As the audience steps in, they will trigger distance sensors
                    and bubble machines to fill the space with phantasmagorical bubbles, which are constantly cut
                    and deformed by the woolen threads, just like the capture and alteration of life moments in the
                    passage of time.</p>
                    <p>The audience is not just a spectator here, they become active participants and witnesses of this
                        dance of life, and every interaction casts an eternal memory. The work symbolises the
                        endlessness of the universe and the colourful changes of life through the black frame and the
                        coloured threads, while the touching bubbles express the fleeting and magical moments of life. More than an art installation, it is a poem depicting the intertwining of the universe, life and
                        emotions, inviting each viewer to feel, reflect and immerse themselves in it, witnessing the
                        growth, reproduction and passing away of life, as well as the entanglement of emotions and the
                        endless division of space.</p></h3>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <h3><p> The wool and the foam in the work present two very different attributes in both form and
                    existence. The contrast between the solid, material existence of the wool and the transient, emptiness of the foam is what forces us to think deeply about life, existence, eternity and the
                    moment.</p>
                    <p> The transient nature of the bubble makes us think about the instantaneous beauty and passing of
                        life. All instantaneous beauty is especially precious. The durability and evergreen nature of wool, in turn, represents the eternity and stability of existence. In the moment the bubble bursts, we see
                        the fragility and transience of life, but it is precisely this transience that makes existence
                        cherished and treasured.</p>
                    <p>Philosophers such as Heidegger and Sartre have explored the question of existence in their
                        philosophical systems. Foam may represent nothingness, suggesting the nihilistic view of life as
                        empty and devoid of meaning. Wool, on the other hand, may be interpreted as real, solid
                        existence. This makes us rethink about the meaning of life; is the real eternal? Is nothingness
                        truly empty? The regular movement of the stepper motor represents the thinking of cause and
                        effect and predestination. Everything has a cause and effect relationship, and destiny may be an
                        unchangeable result. The involvement of the audience introduces another kind of uncertainty to
                        this predestination, which undoubtedly leads us to a new understanding of the relationship
                        between free will and predestination. The audience's participation is not just physical, but more
                        of a spiritual exchange. When they see the bubble bursting and the wool bobbing, they may think
                        more about their own existence and the meaning of life. Is the meaning of life given externally or
                        is it found internally? </p>
                    <p> When people approach the device, the distance sensor is triggered and bubbles are generated, just
                        as the birth and reproduction of life is prompted by external touches, stimuli and factors. The
                        presence of people and the creation of bubbles form a metaphor for the fact that life is often
                        triggered and generated by external factors, the environment, and interactions with other living
                        things.</p>
                    <p> The transient nature of the bubble symbolises the fragility and fallibility of life. Life, like the
                        bubble, is transient but vibrant and beautiful in the moment of its existence. The cutting of the
                        bubble by the silk thread is a direct manifestation of touch and spatial division. It indicates that at
                        every stage of life, one encounters external challenges and impacts that will either toughen life or
                        lead to its end. The extension of the silk thread through space can be seen as the continuation and
                        growth of emotions and life. The cutting foam of the silk thread, on the other hand, expresses the
                        inevitable conflicts, frustrations and emotional twists and turns of life.</p>
                    <p> The presence and proximity of people inspires the creation of bubbles that further interact with
                        the silk threads. This perfectly embodies the theme of touch, growth and reproduction. The
                        human behaviour and the reaction of the installation builds a microscopic model of life, embodying the process of life from birth to extinction, and the various emotions and challenges
                        experienced in between. Each viewer interacts in a different way, which means that the creation
                        of each bubble, the duration of its existence, and its interaction with the filaments are unique. This is just as the experience and destiny of each life is unique.</p>
                    <p> In short, through human interaction with the installation, the audience can experience, perceive
                        and reflect on the themes of life and emotion in the process of actual participation. The
                        interaction between the foam and the silk thread provides an intuitive and in-depth visual
                        metaphor for this theme.</p></h3>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

            
                
            <h3><p>In constructing the spatial structure, I chose three vertical timber-framed cubes, each with its
                own specific function, in order to achieve symmetry and an interactive centre for the system. The
                use of wood was chosen because it is both strong and aesthetically pleasing, adding a natural
                texture to the whole installation </p>
                <p> Ten ropes are connected from belt-driven linear actuators to pulleys in an intermediate box. These ropes abstractly represent human interaction. The movement of the actuators controls the
                    tension and movement of these ropes. The decision to use ropes and pulleys adds a physical and
                    haptic dimension to the project, allowing for a dynamic representation of social interaction.</p>
                <p> Ten steel balls are placed on the top surface of the centre box and ten corresponding steel balls
                    are placed on the bottom surface. These steel balls are connected by ropes to create a visual
                    representation of the ebb and flow of human emotions and connections. As the ropes move, they
                    affect the position of these balls, symbolising the chain reaction of human interaction in space
                    In order to bring the concept of foaming and its symbolic representation of emotion into the
                    technical implementation, the foaming machine is semi-openly integrated into the installation. The foaming machine is located on the outer wall of the middle box and consists of several key
                    components.</p>
                <p> lidar sensor: the foaming machine is equipped with a lidar sensor, carefully positioned to detect
                    the proximity of a person to the installation. the lidar sensor acts as a trigger for the entire
                    foaming process, ensuring that it responds dynamically to the presence of the audience. Servo: Two servos play a vital role in controlling the operation of the foaming machine. The
                    exposed servo on the top of the machine controls the internal servo inside the machine. these
                    servos work in tandem to regulate the speed of the bubble carousel, which is the central element
                    in generating the bubbles.</p></h3>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
            <h3><p>Based on the existing lidar sensor, more types of sensors (e.g. sound, temperature, light sensors)
                can be added to achieve a richer audience interaction experience. In addition to this an immersive
                art experience can be provided to the audience, allowing them to explore and feel the world of
                installation art more deeply through AR and VR technologies. Combine installation art with
                music, video and other multimedia elements to form a full-sensory art experience. Through the
                dynamic control of lighting, colour and other visual elements, it presents the audience with an
                ever-changing and evolving art scene. Through artificial intelligence technology, intelligent
                analysis and prediction of the audience's behaviour is achieved, so that the installation can
                anticipate and respond to the audience's interactive behaviour in advance. By connecting the
                installation with other devices, we can realise cross-platform and cross-device interaction, creating a more open and shared art ecosystem.</p></h3>
